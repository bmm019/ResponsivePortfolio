            <p>My name is Brittany McNulty and I am super excited about taking my career to the next level through this bootcamp. I have a passion for problem-solving, being creative and bringing ideas to life. Upon graduating from Sam Houston State University in 2013 which a B.S. in Psychology, I immediately found myself in a Product Support role supporting websites and their functionality. I live for the ever-changing technology and keeping up with the latest trends. Since then, I have been in multiple digital and technical roles supporting/optimizing websites. Most recently, I was in a role to produce clean, modern and responsive designs and bring them to life using platforms such as Spacecraft.

                In my spare time I enjoy taking photos of my Goldendoodle (Darly) for her instagram, traveling and trying all of the delightful restaurants in Austin, TX.
